## Codebase Patterns
- Supabase client initialized in src/lib/supabase.ts with environment variable validation
- Database schema uses RLS policies with auth.uid() = user_id pattern for all user-scoped tables
- All sync-enabled tables include last_modified_ms BIGINT for conflict resolution
- Storage bucket pattern: {userId}/{matchId}_{timestamp}.jpg for user-specific uploads
- Zustand stores follow pattern: create<StateInterface>((set, get) => ({...})) with typed hooks
- Auth flow: AuthGuard wraps protected routes, redirects to /auth if not authenticated
- Supabase Auth UI component handles OAuth (Google) with custom theme matching design system
- Session persistence automatic via Supabase localStorage, 7-day expiry

---

## 2026-02-08 15:54:32 - US-P001
- **What was implemented:**
  - Installed Supabase dependencies (@supabase/supabase-js, @supabase/auth-helpers-react)
  - Created Supabase client configuration in src/lib/supabase.ts
  - Created comprehensive database schema SQL file (src/db/supabase-schema.sql) with:
    * Core tables: user_profiles, players, venues, matches, games, rally_analyses
    * Social tables: friendships, groups, group_members, leaderboard_cache, activity_log
    * RLS policies on all tables enforcing auth.uid() = user_id
    * Performance indexes on critical query paths
    * Storage bucket (match-photos) with RLS for photo uploads
  - Created .env.local template with setup instructions (not committed)
  - Created README-SUPABASE.md with comprehensive setup guide

- **Files changed:**
  - package.json, package-lock.json (added Supabase dependencies)
  - src/lib/supabase.ts (new - Supabase client with TypeScript types)
  - src/db/supabase-schema.sql (new - complete database schema)
  - .env.local (new - template, gitignored)
  - README-SUPABASE.md (new - setup guide)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern: @supabase/auth-helpers-react is deprecated (warning shown), but still functional for MVP. Consider migrating to newer auth patterns in future iterations.
  - Pattern: Environment variable validation in supabase.ts logs warning if variables missing, preventing silent failures
  - Pattern: Database schema includes groups/leaderboards tables early to avoid migrations later
  - Gotcha: .env.local should NEVER be committed (already in .gitignore via *.local pattern)
  - Context: Schema SQL file is meant to be run manually in Supabase SQL Editor - not auto-applied
  - Context: Storage bucket RLS uses storage.foldername(name)[1] pattern to extract userId from path

## ✅ US-P001 Complete: Supabase Project Setup

I've successfully implemented the foundation story for SquashIQ PWA v2.0. Here's what was accomplished:

### What Was Implemented

1. **Dependencies Installed**
   - `@supabase/supabase-js` v2.95.3 - Core Supabase client
   - `@supabase/auth-helpers-react` v0.15.0 - Auth helpers (note: deprecated but functional)

2. **Supabase Client Configuration**
   - Created `src/lib/supabase.ts` with:
     - Environment variable validation (warns if not configured)
     - TypeScript database types for all tables
     - Auth configuration with PKCE flow and session persistence

3. **Comprehensive Database Schema**
   - Created `src/db/supabase-schema.sql` with:
     - **Core tables**: user_profiles, players, venues, matches, games, rally_analyses
     - **Social tables**: friendships, groups, group_members, leaderboard_cache, activity_log
     - **RLS policies** on ALL tables (auth.uid() = user_id pattern)
     - **Performance indexes** on critical query paths
     - **Storage bucket** (match-photos) with user-scoped RLS
     - All sync tables include `last_modified_ms` for conflict resolution

4. **Setup Documentation**
   - `.env.local` template with detailed instructions (not committed to git)
   - `README-SUPABASE.md` with comprehensive guide covering:
     - Supabase project creation
     - Database schema deployment
     - Google OAuth setup (Google Cloud Console + Supabase)
     - Storage configuration
     - Development tips and troubleshooting

### Quality Checks
- ✅ Typecheck passed
- ✅ Build successful (1.89s)
- ✅ All files committed to `ralph/squashiq-pwa-v2` branch

### Next Steps
The next user story is **US-P002: Authentication UI with Google Sign In**, which will build on this foundation to implement the auth flow.

## 2026-02-08 16:00:00 - US-P002
- **What was implemented:**
  - Installed @supabase/auth-ui-react and @supabase/auth-ui-shared packages
  - Created Zustand auth store (src/stores/authStore.ts) with:
    * User/session state management
    * Auth initialization on app load
    * Session persistence (auto via Supabase localStorage, 7-day expiry)
    * Sign out functionality with store cleanup
  - Created AuthPage (src/pages/AuthPage.tsx) with:
    * Full-screen landing page with dark theme (#0A0A0A background)
    * SquashIQ logo with gradient (#00E676 to #00C853)
    * Value props: 📊 Deep insights, 🔄 Never lose data, 👥 Compete with friends
    * Supabase Auth UI component with Google OAuth
    * Custom theme matching app design system (primary #00E676, surface #1A1A1A)
  - Created AuthCallback (src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx) to handle OAuth redirect
  - Created AuthGuard (src/components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx) to protect routes
  - Updated App.tsx routing to separate public (/auth, /auth/callback) and protected routes
  - Added logout to Settings with confirmation dialog and email display

- **Files changed:**
  - package.json, package-lock.json (added auth UI dependencies)
  - src/stores/authStore.ts (new - Zustand auth store)
  - src/pages/AuthPage.tsx (new - Google Sign In landing page)
  - src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx (new - OAuth callback handler)
  - src/components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx (new - protected route wrapper)
  - src/App.tsx (updated routing with AuthGuard wrapper)
  - src/components/settings/Settings.tsx (added logout button)
  - README-SUPABASE.md (updated testing instructions)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern: Zustand auth store follows same pattern as other stores (useAuthStore hook)
  - Pattern: AuthGuard initializes auth on mount, redirects to /auth if not authenticated
  - Pattern: Supabase Auth UI component handles all OAuth flows (no custom forms needed)
  - Pattern: Auth callback uses supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession() to complete OAuth
  - Gotcha: Must initialize auth store in App.tsx useEffect to get session on app load
  - Gotcha: Session persistence is automatic via Supabase (localStorage), expires after 7 days
  - Context: Auth UI theme customization uses @supabase/auth-ui-shared ThemeSupa
  - Context: Protected routes wrapped in AuthGuard, public routes (/auth, /auth/callback) outside
  - Browser testing note: Manual browser verification needed (no automated browser tools available)
  - Next: US-P003 will check for user_profiles record on first sign-in

## ✅ US-P002 Complete: Authentication UI with Google Sign In

I've successfully implemented US-P002! Here's what was accomplished:

### What Was Implemented

1. **Dependencies Installed**
   - `@supabase/auth-ui-react` v0.4.7 - Pre-built auth UI components
   - `@supabase/auth-ui-shared` v0.1.8 - Shared theme utilities

2. **Auth Store** (`src/stores/authStore.ts`)
   - User/session state management with Zustand
   - Auth initialization on app load
   - Session persistence (automatic via Supabase, 7-day expiry)
   - Sign out functionality with store cleanup

3. **AuthPage** (`src/pages/AuthPage.tsx`)
   - Full-screen landing page with dark theme (#0A0A0A)
   - SquashIQ logo with gradient (#00E676 → #00C853)
   - Value props section: 📊 Deep insights, 🔄 Never lose data, 👥 Compete with friends
   - Supabase Auth UI component with Google OAuth
   - Custom theme matching the app's design system

4. **Auth Callback Handler** (`src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx`)
   - Processes OAuth redirect from Google
   - Exchanges code for session
   - Redirects to Dashboard on success

5. **Protected Routes** (`src/components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx`)
   - Wraps all protected routes
   - Redirects to `/auth` if not authenticated
   - Shows loading state during initialization

6. **Routing Updates** (`src/App.tsx`)
   - Public routes: `/auth`, `/auth/callback`
   - Protected routes: all app routes wrapped in `<AuthGuard>`
   - Auth initialization on app mount

7. **Logout Functionality** (`src/components/settings/Settings.tsx`)
   - Account section shows signed-in email
   - Sign Out button with confirmation dialog
   - Clears session and redirects to `/auth`

8. **Documentation**
   - Updated `README-SUPABASE.md` with testing instructions

### Quality Checks
- ✅ Typecheck passed (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- ✅ Build successful (2.04s, 422KB gzipped)
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Changes committed to `ralph/squashiq-pwa-v2` branch

### Codebase Patterns Discovered
- Zustand stores follow consistent pattern across the codebase
- AuthGuard pattern for protecting routes
- Supabase Auth UI handles all OAuth complexity
- Session persistence is automatic via Supabase

### Next Steps
The next user story is **US-P003: User profile creation on first sign-in**, which will:
- Check for `user_profiles` record after auth
- Show profile setup modal for new users
- Create default player record

**Note:** Browser testing requires manual verification (no automated browser tools available). To test:
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Visit `http://localhost:5173`
3. Should redirect to `/auth`
4. Click "Continue with Google"
5. Complete OAuth flow
6. Should redirect to Dashboard
7. Session persists on refresh

## 2026-02-08 16:15:00 - US-P003
- **What was implemented:**
  - Created ProfileSetupModal component (src/components/auth/ProfileSetupModal.tsx) with:
    * Username input with validation (3-20 chars, alphanumeric + underscores)
    * Display name input (pre-filled with email username)
    * Real-time username uniqueness check against Supabase
    * Error handling with user-friendly messages
    * Creates user_profiles record with default settings (privacy='friends', tier='free')
    * Creates default player record with is_current_user=true
  - Updated AuthGuard (src/components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx) with:
    * Profile existence check after authentication
    * Shows ProfileSetupModal if profile doesn't exist
    * Loading state during profile check
    * Completion callback to update profileComplete flag
  - Updated authStore (src/stores/authStore.ts) with:
    * Added profileComplete flag to state
    * setProfileComplete action
    * Clears profileComplete on sign out

- **Files changed:**
  - src/components/auth/ProfileSetupModal.tsx (new - profile setup modal)
  - src/components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx (updated - added profile check logic)
  - src/stores/authStore.ts (updated - added profileComplete state)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern: Profile check uses PGRST116 error code to detect "no rows" (profile doesn't exist)
  - Pattern: Username uniqueness check uses .single() query, expects PGRST116 for available usernames
  - Pattern: Modal is rendered inside AuthGuard instead of children when profile setup needed
  - Gotcha: Username stored as lowercase for case-insensitive lookups
  - Gotcha: Display name defaults to email username (e.g., "john" from "john@example.com")
  - Context: Default player record created with is_current_user=true to distinguish user from opponents
  - Context: Privacy setting defaults to 'friends', user tier defaults to 'free'
  - Context: crypto.randomUUID() used for player ID (not auth.uid since one user can have multiple players)
  - Browser testing note: Manual verification needed - new user should see profile setup modal after OAuth
  - Next: US-P004 will handle migration from IndexedDB to Supabase for existing users
