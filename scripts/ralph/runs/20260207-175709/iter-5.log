US-013 is complete. There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-014 through US-041), so another iteration will pick up the next story.

**Summary of US-013 completion:**

- **Rewrote `src/pages/MatchDetail.tsx`** from a placeholder into a full match detail page with three modes:

  **Read-only view:**
  - Opponent emoji + name, date/time, venue with pin icon, format (Bo3/Bo5), overall result colored green/red
  - Game scores as individual cards with game number, scores colored by winner, flame emoji for tight games
  - Tags section showing energy level (with emoji), vibe, and quick tags as pills
  - Match note displayed in a card if present
  - Recommendation text displayed with green left border if present
  - Back navigation arrow in header

  **Edit mode:**
  - "Edit" button toggles into inline edit mode with pre-filled data from the existing match
  - Score editing with +/- buttons (48px touch targets) and quick presets (11-0, 11-5, 11-8, 11-9)
  - Tight game indicator, match result banner, collapsible unneeded games — same UX as the log flow
  - Energy level, vibe, quick tags, and note editing — reuses same UI patterns from StepTagsSave
  - "Save Changes" overwrites existing match record and re-creates game records
  - "Cancel" returns to read-only view

  **Delete:**
  - "Delete" button shows confirmation dialog: "Delete this match? This cannot be undone."
  - On confirm, deletes match + associated game records and navigates back to Dashboard

- Typecheck, build, and lint all pass
- Committed as `feat: US-013 - Match detail view with edit and delete`
