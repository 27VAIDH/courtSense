US-012 is complete. There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-013 through US-041), so another iteration will pick up the next story.

**Summary of US-012 completion:**

- **MatchHistoryList component** (`src/components/matches/MatchHistoryList.tsx`): Displays all matches as tappable cards sorted by `createdAt` descending (newest first), each showing:
  - Opponent emoji + name
  - Relative date ("Today", "Yesterday", "Mon Jan 6")
  - Result text ("W 3-1" / "L 1-3") colored green for win / red for loss
  - Venue name in muted text
  - Individual game scores with flame emoji for tight games (isTight=true)
  - **Loading state**: 3 skeleton placeholder cards with pulse animation
  - **Empty state**: "No matches yet" with racket emoji and green CTA button linking to /log
  - Tapping a card navigates to `/match/:id`
- **Dashboard page** (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`): Updated from placeholder to show "Match History" header + MatchHistoryList
- **MatchDetail page** (`src/pages/MatchDetail.tsx`): Placeholder for US-013, with back navigation
- **App.tsx**: Added `/match/:id` route for match detail navigation
- Uses Dexie `useLiveQuery` hooks for reactive updates when new matches are saved
- Typecheck passes, build succeeds
- Committed as `feat: US-012 - Match history list`
