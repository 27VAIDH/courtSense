US-014 is complete. There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-015 through US-041), so another iteration will pick up the next story.

**Summary of US-014 completion:**

- **Rewrote `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`** from a simple match history wrapper into a full dashboard layout with:
  - **Header section**: Player name from current user record, overall record as "XW - YL" computed from all matches
  - **Current form indicator**: Last 5 match results displayed as colored W/L letters (green for win, red for loss)
  - **Insight cards container**: Scrollable `space-y-3` section with "Insights" header — placeholder for US-015 through US-022 cards
  - **Match history section**: Existing MatchHistoryList component below insights
  - **Skeleton loading**: Three skeleton sections (header, insight cards, match history) shown while Dexie data loads
  - **Empty state**: "Welcome to SquashIQ!" with racket emoji, encouraging text, and large green "Log First Match" CTA button
- Typecheck passes, build succeeds
- Committed as `feat: US-014 - Dashboard layout and header with stats`
- PRD updated with `passes: true` for US-014
- Progress log updated with learnings
