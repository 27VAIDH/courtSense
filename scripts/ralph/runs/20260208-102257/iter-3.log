Perfect! Let me provide a summary of what was completed.

## Summary

I've successfully implemented **US-032: Pressure Performance — 8-8+ Index display**.

### What was implemented:

1. **ClutchRating insight card component** (`src/components/insights/ClutchRating.tsx`):
   - Large animated clutch rating number (0-100) with Framer Motion
   - Rating labels with color coding:
     - Ice Veins (cyan) for 80+
     - Hot (orange) for 60-79
     - Neutral (yellow) for 40-59
     - Cold (blue) for 0-39
   - Trend arrow comparing last 5 tight games to overall performance
   - Expandable "Clutch by Opponent" section showing per-opponent tight game win rates
   - Expandable "Clutch by Game Number" section showing tight game performance by game position
   - Locked state requiring minimum 5 tight games

2. **Dashboard integration**:
   - Added `clutchRating` to the InsightId type
   - Integrated the card into the Dashboard's insight system
   - Added unlock logic based on tight games count

### Files changed:
- `src/components/insights/ClutchRating.tsx` (new)
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- `src/stores/insightStore.ts`
- `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
- `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`

### Quality checks:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passed (`tsc -b`)
- ✅ Build succeeded (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Committed with proper message including co-author attribution
- ✅ PRD updated to mark US-032 as `passes: true`
- ✅ Progress log updated with learnings

The implementation follows the established patterns from other insight cards, uses the same locked state UX, and integrates seamlessly with the progressive unlocking system.
