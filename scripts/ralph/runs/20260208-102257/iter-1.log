Perfect! I have successfully completed US-030 (Rally Pattern Analyzer). Let me provide a summary:

## Summary

I've successfully implemented **US-030 - Rally Pattern Analyzer with swipeable card UI**. 

### What was implemented:

1. **RallyAnalyzer Component** (`src/components/rally/RallyAnalyzer.tsx`):
   - Full-screen modal with 5 sequential swipeable cards
   - Framer Motion drag gestures for horizontal swipe navigation
   - Card 1: Win method selection (single-select from 5 options)
   - Card 2: Lose method selection (single-select from 5 options)
   - Card 3: Rally length selection (single-select from 3 options)
   - Card 4: Court coverage selection (single-select from 4 options)
   - Card 5: Best shots selection (multi-select, max 2 from 7 options)
   - Progress dots showing position (1-5)
   - Skip button on each card
   - Data saved to `rally_analyses` table in Dexie.js

2. **Integration Points**:
   - **PostMatchSaved page**: "Want to add rally details?" is now a clickable button that opens the analyzer
   - **MatchDetail page**: Added "Add Rally Analysis" button (if no analysis exists) or displays existing rally analysis data

3. **Bug Fixes**:
   - Fixed lint errors in `src/lib/milestones.ts` (removed unused Game import/parameter, changed `let` to `const`)
   - Updated `src/pages/Timeline.tsx` to match new function signature

### Quality Checks:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes (`npm run build`)
- ✅ ESLint passes (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ Code committed with proper commit message
- ✅ PRD updated (US-030 marked as `passes: true`)
- ✅ Progress logged to `progress.txt`

There are still **11 stories remaining** with `passes: false`. The next iteration will pick up US-031 (Rally insights generation and display).
