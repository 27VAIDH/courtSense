There are still 10 user stories with `passes: false`, so I'm not done yet. Let me complete this iteration by summarizing what was accomplished:

## Summary

I successfully implemented **US-031: Rally insights generation and display**. Here's what was completed:

### What was implemented:
1. **Rally Insights Library** (`src/lib/rallyInsights.ts`):
   - Created play style classification function that analyzes rally data
   - Determines player style based on win method, rally length, and court coverage
   - Supports 5 play styles: Aggressive Attacker, Patient Constructor, Retriever, Serve & Volley, All-Court Player

2. **Win Method Distribution Card** (`src/components/insights/WinMethodDistribution.tsx`):
   - Donut chart showing how the player wins points
   - Color-coded legend with percentages
   - Requires minimum 5 rally analyses to unlock

3. **Loss Method Distribution Card** (`src/components/insights/LossMethodDistribution.tsx`):
   - Donut chart showing how the player loses points
   - Highlights the biggest loss method with improvement suggestion
   - Action-oriented suggestions like "Focus on consistency over power"

4. **Best Shot Trends Card** (`src/components/insights/BestShotTrends.tsx`):
   - Bubble visualization where size = frequency
   - Color-coded shot types with emojis
   - Top 3 shots shown in legend below bubbles

5. **Integration**:
   - Added new insight IDs to `insightStore.ts`
   - Updated Dashboard to import and render all three rally insight cards
   - All cards follow the same locked state pattern as existing insights

### Quality checks:
✅ TypeScript compilation passed  
✅ Build successful  
✅ All code committed with proper message  
✅ PRD updated (US-031 now has `passes: true`)  
✅ Progress log updated with learnings

The implementation follows all existing patterns from the codebase and is ready for the next iteration to pick up **US-032**.
