## Summary

I successfully completed **US-041: Empty states and onboarding flow**, which was the final user story in the SquashIQ project!

### What was implemented:

1. **3-Screen Swipeable Onboarding** (`src/components/onboarding/Onboarding.tsx`)
   - Screen 1: "Log matches in 60 seconds" with ⚡ icon
   - Screen 2: "Discover what makes you win" with 📊 icon  
   - Screen 3: "Track your improvement" with 📈 icon
   - Smooth swipe/drag gestures using Framer Motion
   - Skip button and Next navigation
   - Only shown on first app load (localStorage flag)

2. **Enhanced Empty States** across all screens:
   - **Dashboard**: Already had excellent empty state with "Welcome to SquashIQ!" 
   - **Timeline**: Added timeline illustration (📊 → 📈) with encouraging message
   - **Rivals**: Added rivalry illustration (🏸 ⚔️ 🏸) with clear CTA
   - **Match History**: Improved copy "No matches yet — let's fix that!"

3. **Onboarding State Management** (`src/lib/onboarding.ts`)
   - localStorage utilities to track completion
   - Integrated into App.tsx to show on first load only

### Quality Checks:
