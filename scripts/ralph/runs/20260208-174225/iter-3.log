Perfect! I've successfully completed **US-P006: Photo upload to Supabase Storage with offline queue**. 

## Summary

I've implemented a comprehensive photo upload system for SquashIQ with the following features:

### ✅ What Was Implemented

1. **Image Compression**
   - Installed `browser-image-compression` package
   - Compresses images to max 1920px width, 85% JPEG quality
   - Uses web workers for non-blocking compression

2. **Photo Upload Utilities** (`src/lib/photoUpload.ts`)
   - `compressImage()` - Optimizes images for upload
   - `uploadMatchPhoto()` - Uploads to Supabase Storage bucket
   - `generatePhotoFilename()` - Format: `{userId}/{matchId}_{timestamp}.jpg`
   - `processPhotoUploadQueue()` - Background worker for offline uploads
   - `deleteMatchPhoto()` - Removes photos from storage

3. **Offline Queue System**
   - Added `photo_upload_queue` table to IndexedDB (version 2)
   - Stores photos as base64 when offline
   - Processes queue when app comes online
   - Retry logic with max 5 attempts per upload

4. **Match Logging Integration**
   - Photo upload UI with camera icon placeholder
   - Live preview with remove button
   - Offline indicator when photo will upload later
   - Photo failures don't block match save

5. **Photo Display**
   - Shows photos in match detail page
   - Lazy loading for performance
   - Legacy `photoBase64` fallback support
   - Deletes photos from storage when match deleted

6. **Background Processing**
   - Processes upload queue on app load
   - Listens for 'online' event
   - Updates match records with public URLs after upload

### 🎯 Quality Checks
- ✅ TypeScript type checking passed
- ✅ Build successful (1.98s, 450.89KB gzipped)
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Changes committed to `ralph/squashiq-pwa-v2` branch

### 📋 Next Steps
The next user story is **US-P007: Performance optimization - code splitting and bundle size**, which is currently `passes: false`. There are still 12 user stories remaining to complete.
