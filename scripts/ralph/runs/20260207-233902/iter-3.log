US-025 is complete. There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-026 through US-041), so another iteration will pick up the next story.

**Summary of US-025 completion:**

- **Created** `src/components/recommendations/RecommendationCard.tsx` — Reusable tappable expand/collapse card with emoji, headline, and expandable context text. Supports `compact` mode for dashboard use and `label` prop.
- **Updated** `src/pages/PostMatchSaved.tsx` — Added recommendation card below the streak toast on the post-match save screen, parsing the JSON from `match.recommendationText`
- **Updated** `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` — Added pinned compact recommendation card at the top of the dashboard (above insight cards) showing the most recent match's recommendation with "Focus for next match:" label
- **Updated** `src/pages/MatchDetail.tsx` — Replaced raw text display with proper `RecommendationCard` component that parses the JSON recommendation
- Build passes, typecheck passes
- Committed as `feat: US-025 - Post-match recommendation display`
- PRD updated with `passes: true` for US-025
- Progress log updated with codebase patterns and learnings
