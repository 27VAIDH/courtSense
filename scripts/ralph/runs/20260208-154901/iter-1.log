## ✅ US-P001 Complete: Supabase Project Setup

I've successfully implemented the foundation story for SquashIQ PWA v2.0. Here's what was accomplished:

### What Was Implemented

1. **Dependencies Installed**
   - `@supabase/supabase-js` v2.95.3 - Core Supabase client
   - `@supabase/auth-helpers-react` v0.15.0 - Auth helpers (note: deprecated but functional)

2. **Supabase Client Configuration**
   - Created `src/lib/supabase.ts` with:
     - Environment variable validation (warns if not configured)
     - TypeScript database types for all tables
     - Auth configuration with PKCE flow and session persistence

3. **Comprehensive Database Schema**
   - Created `src/db/supabase-schema.sql` with:
     - **Core tables**: user_profiles, players, venues, matches, games, rally_analyses
     - **Social tables**: friendships, groups, group_members, leaderboard_cache, activity_log
     - **RLS policies** on ALL tables (auth.uid() = user_id pattern)
     - **Performance indexes** on critical query paths
     - **Storage bucket** (match-photos) with user-scoped RLS
     - All sync tables include `last_modified_ms` for conflict resolution

4. **Setup Documentation**
   - `.env.local` template with detailed instructions (not committed to git)
   - `README-SUPABASE.md` with comprehensive guide covering:
     - Supabase project creation
     - Database schema deployment
     - Google OAuth setup (Google Cloud Console + Supabase)
     - Storage configuration
     - Development tips and troubleshooting

### Quality Checks
- ✅ Typecheck passed
- ✅ Build successful (1.89s)
- ✅ All files committed to `ralph/squashiq-pwa-v2` branch

### Next Steps
The next user story is **US-P002: Authentication UI with Google Sign In**, which will build on this foundation to implement the auth flow.
