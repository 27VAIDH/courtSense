US-019 is complete. Here's what was implemented:

**US-019 — Insight card: Deciding Game Performance**

- **New component** `src/components/insights/DecidingGames.tsx`: Donut chart showing win/loss split in deciding games (Game 3 in Bo3, Game 5 in Bo5)
  - Recharts PieChart with inner/outer radius for donut visualization
  - Green (#00E676) for wins, red (#FF5252) for losses
  - Center percentage display overlaid on the donut
  - Win rate + trend arrow (up/down/flat based on last 5 deciding games vs overall)
  - Win/loss count breakdown
  - Only counts matches that actually went to the deciding game (scores > 0)
  - **Locked state** when <8 deciding games: dimmed placeholder with lock icon and progress text
- **Dashboard updated** (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`): Added `useGames()` hook, games loading check, and `DecidingGames` rendered below VenueEffect
- Typecheck passes, build succeeds
- Committed as `feat: US-019 - Insight card — Deciding Game Performance`

There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-020 through US-041), so another iteration will pick up the next story.
