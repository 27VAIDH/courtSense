**US-017 is complete.** Here's what was implemented:

**US-017 — Insight card: Day of Week Performance ("Best Days")**

- **New component** `src/components/insights/BestDays.tsx`: 7-column bar chart using Recharts showing win rate per day of the week
  - Each bar height represents win rate (0-100%) on that day
  - Days with matches shown in primary color (#00E676), days without matches grayed out (#242424)
  - Best performing day highlighted with accent color (#FF6D00) and labeled at top (e.g. "Tuesdays: 80%")
  - Bar opacity scales with win rate for visual intensity
  - Minimum 10 total matches required to show
  - **Locked state** with dimmed placeholder bars, lock icon, "Log X more matches to unlock" text, and a progress bar showing how close the user is to unlocking
- **Dashboard updated** (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`): BestDays rendered below EnergyImpact in the insight cards container
- Typecheck passes, build succeeds
- Committed as `feat: US-017 - Insight card — Day of Week Performance`

There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-018 through US-041), so another iteration will pick up the next story.
