## ✅ US-P009 Complete: iOS-specific polish with safe areas and PWA install prompt

I've successfully implemented US-P009! Here's what was accomplished:

### What Was Implemented

1. **Safe Area CSS**
   - **BottomTabBar**: Added `padding-bottom: calc(0.5rem + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))` to respect iOS home indicator
   - **Dashboard Header**: Added `padding-top: calc(1.5rem + env(safe-area-inset-top))` to avoid status bar overlap
   - Applied safe area padding to loading and empty states

2. **Overscroll Bounce Disable**
   - Set `overscroll-behavior-y: none` on body element
   - Prevents iOS rubber-band scrolling for a native-like feel

3. **PWA Install Banner** (`src/components/pwa/PWAInstallBanner.tsx`)
   - Detects if already installed using `matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)')`
   - Detects iOS Safari (checks user agent)
   - Shows dismissible banner: "Add SquashIQ to your home screen"
   - **"How to Install" button** reveals step-by-step instructions:
     1. Tap the Share button at the bottom of Safari
     2. Scroll down and tap Add to Home Screen
     3. Tap Add in the top-right corner
   - Stores dismissal flag in localStorage
   - Positioned at `bottom-20` to avoid tab bar overlap
   - Gradient background with backdrop blur effect

4. **iOS Icon Sizes Generated**
   - 180x180 (iPhone home screen)
   - 167x167 (iPad Pro)
   - 152x152 (iPad)
   - 120x120 (iPhone)
   - All icons properly scaled with adjusted viewBox and elements

5. **Manifest & Meta Tags**
   - Updated vite.config.ts to include 180x180 icon
   - Confirmed theme_color and background_color both set to #0A0A0A
   - index.html already had correct iOS meta tags (verified)

### Quality Checks
- ✅ Typecheck passed (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- ✅ Build successful (3.92s, 211.21KB gzipped main bundle)
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Changes committed to `ralph/squashiq-pwa-v2` branch
- ✅ PRD updated (`passes: true`)
- ✅ Progress log updated

### Key Patterns Discovered
- Safe area CSS uses `calc()` to combine base padding with `env(safe-area-inset-*)`
- PWA install detection: check `display-mode: standalone` before showing banner
- iOS detection: User agent check for iPad/iPhone/iPod + Safari (not Chrome)
- Banner positioned above tab bar to avoid overlap

### Next Steps
**US-P010: Accessibility improvements - WCAG AA compliance** is next with `passes: false`. There are still **9 user stories** remaining to complete.

**Browser Testing Note:** Manual verification required on physical iOS device:
1. Test safe areas - content should not be hidden behind status bar or home indicator
2. Test install banner - should appear on iOS Safari, dismissible
3. Test Add to Home Screen - app should install as standalone PWA
4. Test overscroll - no rubber-band bounce effect
