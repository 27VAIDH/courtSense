Perfect! US-P008 is now marked as `passes: true`. Let me provide a final summary:

## ✅ US-P008 Complete: Touch interactions - swipe gestures and haptic feedback

I've successfully implemented US-P008! Here's what was accomplished:

### What Was Implemented

1. **Haptics Library** (`src/lib/haptics.ts`)
   - `triggerLightHaptic()` - 10ms vibration for button presses
   - `triggerSuccessHaptic()` - 3-burst pattern for match save success
   - `triggerErrorHaptic()` - 2-burst pattern for errors
   - Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
   - Uses Vibration API (web standard)

2. **Button/Chip Components Enhanced**
   - Automatic haptic feedback on all button/chip presses
   - Optional `disableHaptic` prop for custom behavior
   - Already meet 44x44px touch target requirement ✅ (`min-h-[48px]`)

3. **Match Logging Swipe Navigation** (`LogMatch.tsx`)
   - Swipe left to go to next step (Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3)
   - Swipe right to go to previous step
   - 100px swipe threshold
   - Framer Motion animation with opacity transform
   - Haptic feedback on step change

4. **Swipeable Match Cards** (`SwipeableMatchCard.tsx`)
   - iOS-style swipe-to-delete interaction
   - Swipe left reveals delete button (-80px constraint)
   - Swipe right dismisses delete action
   - Red background tint during swipe
   - Delete confirmation dialog to prevent accidents
   - Spring physics animation (stiffness: 300, damping: 30)

5. **Match Save Success Haptic**
   - 3-burst haptic pattern when match saved successfully
   - Energy level buttons have haptic feedback
   - All chip selections trigger haptic

### Quality Checks
- ✅ Typecheck passed (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- ✅ Build successful (3.42s, 209.92KB gzipped main bundle)
- ✅ All touch targets meet 44x44px minimum size
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Changes committed to `ralph/squashiq-pwa-v2` branch
- ✅ PRD updated (`passes: true`)
- ✅ Progress log updated

### Key Patterns Discovered
- Haptics utility pattern with `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- Framer Motion drag gestures for swipe interactions (no need for @use-gesture/react's bind)
- Spring physics for natural-feeling animations
- Touch targets already enforced throughout codebase with `min-h-[48px]`

### Next Steps
**US-P009: iOS-specific polish - safe areas and PWA install prompt** is next with `passes: false`. There are still 10 user stories remaining to complete.

**Browser Testing Note:** Manual verification required on physical mobile device:
1. Test swipe gestures in match logging (left/right navigation)
2. Test swipe-to-delete on match cards
3. Verify haptic feedback triggers on buttons and match save
4. Check that haptics respect `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
