There are still more stories with `passes: false`. Since I've completed US-029 successfully, the workflow is complete for this iteration. According to the Ralph instructions:

> After completing a user story, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`.
> If ALL stories are complete and passing, reply with: `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`
> If there are still stories with `passes: false`, end your response normally (another iteration will pick up the next story).

## Summary

I've successfully completed **US-029: Timeline — Milestone detection and display**. Here's what was implemented:

### Features Added:
1. **Milestone Detection Engine** (`src/lib/milestones.ts`):
   - Detects first wins against each opponent
   - Tracks win streaks of 3+, 5+, and 10+
   - Records match count milestones (10, 25, 50, 100 matches)
   - Monitors win rate thresholds (50%, 60%, 70%)
   - Identifies head-to-head record flips

2. **Visual Milestone Markers**:
   - Orange dots on Win/Loss River chart marking milestone achievements
   - Positioned at exact match date/momentum coordinates

3. **Milestone List Component** (`src/components/timeline/MilestoneList.tsx`):
   - Scrollable list showing all achievements chronologically
   - Each milestone displays: icon, title, description, and relative date
   - Empty state for users with no milestones yet

4. **Timeline Integration**:
   - Milestones recalculate reactively after each match save
   - Positioned below Activity Heatmap and Regularity Streak

### Quality Checks:
✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors  
✅ All files committed with proper commit message  
✅ PRD updated to mark US-029 as `passes: true`  
✅ Progress log appended with implementation details and learnings

There are still incomplete user stories (US-030 through US-041), so another iteration will continue with the next priority story.
