   - Comeback Artist (Legendary): Win after 0-2 down with tight game
   - Heartbreaker (Rare): 3+ tight wins in single Bo5
   - Pressure Cooker (Common): 5+ tight games in one week

2. **Badge State Management** (`src/stores/badgeStore.ts`)
   - Zustand store with localStorage persistence
   - Tracks earned badges and new badges queue
   - Auto-detects new achievements

3. **Badge Display** (`src/components/badges/BadgeGrid.tsx`)
