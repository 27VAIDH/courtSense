Good! The next story is US-036. My work on US-035 is complete. Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

I successfully implemented **US-035: Archetype display with radar chart**. Here's what was completed:

### Implementation Details:

1. **Created ArchetypeCard component** (`src/components/archetype/ArchetypeCard.tsx`):
   - Full-width card with dynamic archetype color border
   - Displays archetype name, description, strength, and growth area
   - 6-trait radar chart using Recharts (aggression, fitness, consistency, clutch, adaptability, deception)
   - Shows secondary archetype when within 10% match score
   - Locked state when minimum data requirements not met (10 matches + 5 rally analyses)

2. **Created ArchetypeEvolution component** (`src/components/archetype/ArchetypeEvolution.tsx`):
   - Displays archetype changes over time
   - Shows badges with archetype initial and month/year labels
   - Only displays when archetype has changed at least once

3. **Created archetypeHistoryStore** (`src/stores/archetypeHistoryStore.ts`):
   - Zustand store with localStorage persistence
   - Tracks archetype changes with dates
   - Prevents duplicate entries for same archetype

4. **Updated Card component** (`src/components/ui/Card.tsx`):
   - Added optional `style` prop for inline styles
   - Enables dynamic border coloring for archetype card

5. **Updated Profile page** (`src/pages/Profile.tsx`):
   - Added ArchetypeCard above BadgeGrid
   - Fetches matches, games, and rally analyses data
   - Handles undefined values from hooks

### Quality Checks:
✅ TypeScript compilation passes  
✅ Build completes successfully  
✅ All acceptance criteria met  
✅ Committed with proper message format  
✅ PRD updated to mark US-035 as passing  
✅ Progress logged in progress.txt

The implementation follows all existing codebase patterns and is ready for the next iteration to pick up US-036.
