Perfect! US-038 has been successfully completed. 

## Summary

I've successfully implemented **US-038 - Match of the Month and On This Day**, which adds nostalgic highlight cards to the Dashboard:

### What was implemented:

1. **Match of the Month scoring algorithm** (`src/lib/nostalgiaEngine.ts`):
   - Drama scoring: closest total score difference (+3), most games played (+2), upset win (+2), comeback after losing Game 1 (+1)
   - Auto-selects the most dramatic match from the current or most recent calendar month
   - Generates dramatic titles like "The {opponent} Thriller" or "The {venue} Classic"
   - Requires 4+ matches in the month to display

2. **On This Day detection logic** (`src/lib/nostalgiaEngine.ts`):
   - Checks for matches on the same day 1, 3, 6, or 12 months ago
   - Returns anniversary match with formatted description

3. **Display components**:
   - `MatchOfTheMonth.tsx`: Story-style card with accent border, dismissible with X button, shows opponent, result, venue, and date
   - `OnThisDay.tsx`: Card with secondary border, shows anniversary text with result details

4. **Dashboard integration**: Both cards appear after the recommendation card but before insights

### Quality checks:
- ✅ TypeScript typecheck passes
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ All changes committed with descriptive commit messages
- ✅ PRD updated (US-038 set to `passes: true`)
- ✅ Progress log updated with learnings

There are still **3 incomplete stories** remaining (US-039, US-040, US-041), so another iteration will pick up the next story.
