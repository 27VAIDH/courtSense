There are still stories with `passes: false` (US-038, US-039, US-040, US-041), so this is not the completion point yet.

## Summary

I've successfully completed **US-037: Friendly Leaderboards**!

### What was implemented:
- **Leaderboard calculation engine** (`src/lib/leaderboards.ts`) with 8 categories:
  1. Overall Record - Win rate (min 5 matches)
  2. Iron Man - Matches this calendar month
  3. Clutch King - 8-8+ Index (min 5 tight games)
  4. Comeback Kid - Wins after losing Game 1
  5. Hot Streak - Current consecutive wins
  6. Consistency Crown - Lowest win rate variance (min 20 matches)
  7. Most Improved - Win rate change (last 30d vs prior 30d)
  8. Rivalry Dominator - Best H2H record vs most-played opponent

- **LeaderboardCard component** (`src/components/leaderboards/LeaderboardCard.tsx`) with:
  - Horizontal scrollable category pills for switching between categories
  - Ranked list with position numbers, medals for top 3 (🥇🥈🥉)
  - Current user highlighted with primary color border
  - Encouraging header text based on the leader
  - Empty state for categories with insufficient data

- **Rivals page integration** - Added leaderboards section above the opponent list

### Key technical details:
- Single-device mode: opponent stats computed from matches against current user
- TypeScript compilation passes
- All changes committed with proper message

The implementation is complete and ready for the next iteration!
