Great! US-036 is complete and there are still 5 more stories to work on (US-037 through US-041). Let me provide a summary:

## Summary

Successfully implemented **US-036: Rivalry pages (head-to-head opponent view)**

### What was implemented:
1. **Created RivalryDetail page** (`src/pages/RivalryDetail.tsx`):
   - Header showing both players' emojis and names
   - H2H record display (wins-losses) with large numbers
   - Last 5 results shown as colored dots (W/L)
   - Score History chart using Recharts LineChart showing cumulative H2H momentum
   - Key Stats section: current streak, best win streak, tight games record, avg games/match, most common score
   - Best Win card: highlights the most dominant victory
   - Worst Loss card: shows the worst defeat
   - Fun Facts: auto-generated insights like day-of-week patterns

2. **Updated Rivals page** (`src/pages/Rivals.tsx`):
   - Shows list of all opponents sorted by total matches played
   - Each opponent card displays: emoji, name, H2H record, last match result
   - Tappable cards navigate to the rivalry detail page
   - Empty state with helpful messaging

3. **Made Win Rate by Opponent insight card clickable**:
   - Each opponent bar is now clickable and navigates to their rivalry page
   - Added hover effects and active state styling

4. **Added routing** in App.tsx for `/rivals/:opponentId`

### Quality checks:
✅ TypeScript compilation passes  
✅ Build succeeds  
✅ All code follows existing codebase patterns  
✅ Committed with proper message format  
✅ PRD updated to `passes: true`  
✅ Progress logged with learnings

There are **5 remaining stories** (US-037 through US-041) with `passes: false`, so another iteration will pick up the next story.
