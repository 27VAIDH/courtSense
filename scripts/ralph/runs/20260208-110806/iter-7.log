## Summary

I've successfully completed **US-039 - Season Wrapped (shareable summary cards)**!

### What was implemented:

1. **SeasonWrapped component** - Full-screen swipeable story experience with:
   - Framer Motion drag gestures for horizontal swiping between cards
   - Progress dots showing current position (1-6)
   - Close button to exit the experience
   - Share button on each card

2. **6 Wrapped Cards**:
   - **Card 1: Quarter in Numbers** - Total matches, games, tight games, and estimated hours
   - **Card 2: Win Rate Journey** - Sparkline chart showing rolling 10-match win rate
   - **Card 3: Biggest Rival** - Most-played opponent with H2H record and fun stats
   - **Card 4: Best Month** - Highest win rate month with performance stats
   - **Card 5: Clutch Moments** - Tight games count, 8-8+ Index, and most dramatic game
   - **Card 6: Headline Stat** - Auto-generated standout achievement (win streak, court warrior, etc.)

3. **html2canvas Integration** - Each card can be shared as an image:
   - 1080x1920 resolution for mobile sharing
   - Native share API with fallback to download
   - SquashIQ watermark on each card

4. **Profile Page Integration** - "Season Wrapped" button appears when user has 20+ matches

### Quality checks:
