Perfect! There are still 7 stories with `passes: false`, so I should end normally for the next iteration to continue.

## Summary

I've successfully completed **US-034 - Player Archetype Engine (determination logic)**:

### What was implemented:
- Created `src/lib/archetypes.ts` with complete archetype system
- Defined 6 archetypes with unique characteristics:
  - **The Assassin** (aggressive, high-risk attacking)
  - **The Wall** (fitness-based retriever)
  - **The Strategist** (intelligent, adaptable)
  - **The Closer** (clutch performer)
  - **The Streaker** (momentum-driven)
  - **The Chameleon** (versatile adapter)
- Implemented trait scoring algorithm that analyzes:
  - **Aggression**: from win methods (winners/kill shots)
  - **Fitness**: from rally length (long rallies)
  - **Consistency**: from win rate variance
  - **Clutch**: from tight game performance (8-8+ Index)
  - **Adaptability**: from opponent-specific win rate variance
  - **Deception**: from drop shots/boasts usage
- Created archetype determination function with similarity-based matching
- Secondary archetype shown when within 10% of primary match score
- Enforced minimum requirements: 10 matches AND 5 rally analyses

### Quality checks:
✅ Typecheck passes  
✅ Build succeeds  
✅ Committed with proper message format  
✅ PRD updated (`passes: true`)  
✅ Progress log updated with learnings

The archetype engine is now ready for US-035 to build the UI display with radar chart visualization.
