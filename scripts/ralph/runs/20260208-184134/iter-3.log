Excellent! Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## ✅ US-P012 Complete: Advanced search and filtering for matches

I've successfully implemented US-P012! Here's what was accomplished:

### What Was Implemented

1. **MatchSearchFilter Component** (`src/components/matches/MatchSearchFilter.tsx`)
   - **Search bar** with 300ms debounced input
   - Searches by: opponent name, venue name, match note, date
   - **Quick filter chips**: All/Wins/Losses, This Month/Last Month/This Year
   - **Advanced filters** (collapsible accordion):
     - Opponent multi-select (all opponents)
     - Venue multi-select (all venues)
     - Energy level filter (All/Low/Medium/High)
   - **URL state management**: filters persist in query params
   - **Results count**: "Showing X of Y matches"
   - **Clear Filters** button when any filter is active

2. **MatchHistoryList Updates** (`src/components/matches/MatchHistoryList.tsx`)
   - Integrated MatchSearchFilter at top of match history
   - Filtered matches state management
   - Pagination works with filtered results
   - Enhanced empty state:
     - "No matches found" when filters return no results
     - Original empty state when no matches at all

3. **Filter Features**
   - Debounced search prevents excessive re-renders
   - Timeframe filters with dynamic month/year calculations
   - Multi-select filters for opponents and venues
   - All filters work in combination (AND logic)
   - URL params format: `?search=parth&result=win&timeframe=thisMonth&opponents=1,2&venues=3&energy=High`

### Quality Checks
- ✅ Typecheck passed (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- ✅ Build successful (4.11s, 211.76KB gzipped main bundle)
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Changes committed to `ralph/squashiq-pwa-v2` branch
- ✅ PRD updated (`passes: true`)
- ✅ Progress log updated

### Key Patterns Discovered
- Debounced search uses `useEffect` with `setTimeout` cleanup
- URL state management with `useSearchParams` for filter persistence
- Chip component uses `children` prop, not `label` prop
- Empty state logic checks if filters are active
- Multi-select filters use array state with toggle function

### Remaining Stories
There are **6 user stories** remaining with `passes: false`:
- US-P013: Friend connections - search and send friend requests
- US-P014: Friend profiles - view friends' stats
- US-P015: Global leaderboards with multiple categories
- US-P016: Private groups for squash clubs
- US-P017: User tiers and feature flags architecture
- US-P018: Error monitoring with Sentry

**Browser Testing Note:** Manual verification recommended:
1. Test search - type in search bar, should filter matches
2. Test quick filters - All/Wins/Losses, This Month/Last Month/This Year
3. Test advanced filters - opponent, venue, energy level
4. Test URL params - filters should persist in URL
5. Test Clear Filters button - should reset all filters
6. Test pagination with filters - should work correctly

The project is not yet complete, so another iteration will pick up the next story.
