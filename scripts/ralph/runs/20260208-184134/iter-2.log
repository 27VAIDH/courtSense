Excellent! I have successfully completed **US-P011: Interactive onboarding with sample data**. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## ✅ US-P011 Complete: Interactive onboarding with sample data

### What Was Implemented

1. **Updated Onboarding Component** (`src/components/onboarding/Onboarding.tsx`)
   - Added "Start with sample data" button on final step (Step 3)
   - Shows loading state during sample data generation
   - Secondary button "Skip to logging my own matches" navigates to /log
   - Navigates to Dashboard after sample data generation to show matches

2. **Sample Data Generation Utility** (`src/lib/sampleData.ts`)
   - `generateSampleData()` - Creates 20 realistic matches with:
     - 4 sample opponents: Parth, Hemang, Sarah, Mike
     - 3 sample venues: Downtown Sports Club, Elite Squash Center, City Fitness Squash Courts
     - Random dates within last 90 days
     - 60% win rate for positive UX
     - Random scores, energy levels, formats (Bo3/Bo5), tags
     - Realistic game scores with tight game detection
   - `clearSampleData()` - Deletes all sample data
   - `hasSampleData()` - Checks if sample data exists
   - All records flagged with `sample_data: true`

3. **Sample Data Banner** (`src/components/sampleData/SampleDataBanner.tsx`)
   - Shows on Dashboard when sample data exists
   - Message: "👀 This is sample data. Log your first real match to replace it!"
   - Gradient background matching app theme

4. **Dashboard Integration** (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)
   - Added SampleDataBanner after BackupReminder
   - Banner only shows when sample data exists

5. **Settings - Clear Sample Data** (`src/components/settings/Settings.tsx`)
   - "Clear Sample Data" button in Data Management section
   - Only visible when sample data exists
   - Confirmation dialog before deletion

6. **Database Schema Update** (`src/db/database.ts`)
   - Bumped to version 3
   - Added `sample_data` field to players, venues, matches, games tables
   - Indexed for efficient queries

7. **TypeScript Types** (`src/db/types.ts`)
   - Added `sample_data?: boolean` to Player, Venue, Match, Game interfaces

### Quality Checks
- ✅ Typecheck passed (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- ✅ Build successful (3.87s, 211.44KB gzipped main bundle)
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Changes committed to `ralph/squashiq-pwa-v2` branch
- ✅ PRD updated (`passes: true`)
- ✅ Progress log updated

### Key Patterns Discovered
- Sample data provides instant value for new users without requiring 20 match entries
- 60% win rate creates positive user experience
- `sample_data` flag enables easy bulk deletion
- IndexedDB queries use `.where('sample_data').equals(1)` for filtering
- Database uses camelCase fields (opponentId, venueId), not snake_case

### Remaining Stories
There are **7 user stories** remaining with `passes: false`:
- US-P012: Advanced search and filtering for matches
- US-P013: Friend connections - search and send friend requests
- US-P014: Friend profiles - view friends' stats
- US-P015: Global leaderboards with multiple categories
- US-P016: Private groups for squash clubs
- US-P017: User tiers and feature flags architecture
- US-P018: Error monitoring with Sentry

The project is not yet complete, so another iteration will pick up the next story.
